# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is a form of syntax that stands for JavaScript XML. It lets HTML like code to be written inside JavaScript. JSX can seen being used in the React framework for JavaScript. One difference between HTML and JSX is that JSX allows for javascript functionally within the UI all in the same code. HTML would just render the UI without any functionality.

Researched answer: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript and it stands for JavaScript XML. JSX is used in React to define the structure and appearance of UI components. One difference is that an attributes name in JSX is written in camelCase, while in HTML it is written in kebab-case.

1. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn stands for "yet another resource negotiator" and it is a package manager used for Javascript. It installs certain packages and dependencies for folder you are working in when ran in the terminal. The files that are modified when yarn is ran in the terminal are the package.json, yarn.lock files and the node_modules files are also modified.

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript that is used to manage and install packages and dependencies for your projects. Yarn was developed by Facebook as an alternative to npm. It helps to ensure that your project is using the correct versions of packages and that all dependencies are installed and ready to use. The yarn.lock file, package.json file, and the node_modules are among the files modified when yarn is run in the terminal.

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: A React components are reusable components containing code that is separate from the main react file (App.js) that is export to be rendered. These components can be linked to the main react file (App.js) and can be used in a similar way to how functions can be called.

Researched answer: React components are reusable and self-contained piece of code that encapsulates the functionality and appearance of a part of a user interface. Components are the building blocks of React applications. A React component can be defined using either a class or a function and are written using JSX.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: The difference between state values and props id that state values are managed internally within a React component and can be updated by the component itself through setState(). Props on the other hand, are values passed down to a component from its parent and cannot be directly modified by the component

Researched answer: In React, both state and props are used to manage and pass data between components. Props (short for "properties") are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component while State is used to manage data within a component. Props can be read by the child component that it is passed to but cannot be modified by them. State can be updated using the setState() method regardless if it is created within the child component or not.

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: The DOM stands for Document Object Model and it is a programming interface that represents web pages as a tree-like structure of HTML or XML elements. It provides a way to access and manipulate the content and structure of web pages using programming languages such as JavaScript.

Researched answer: DOM stands for Document Object Model and it is a programming interface for web documents, which represents the structure of a web page as a hierarchical tree of objects. The DOM provides a way for web developers to manipulate and interact with the content and structure of a web page using a scripting language like JavaScript. It is a key concept in modern web development and is used extensively in frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into reusable and modular objects that contain both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

2. Ruby: Ruby is a high-level, dynamic, and object-oriented programming language s known for its simplicity, productivity, and expressive syntax, which emphasizes readability and conciseness.

3. Implicit return: Implicit return is a feature in some programming languages, including Ruby and JavaScript, where a function automatically returns the value of the last expression evaluated within the function body, without the need to use the explicit "return" keyword.

4. Ruby blocks: In Ruby, a block is a piece of code that can be passed to a method as an argument. Blocks are often used in Ruby for iteration and functional programming, where they can be used to define anonymous functions or to pass behavior to higher-order functions.

5. Ruby hashes: In Ruby, a hash is a data structure that represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value.
